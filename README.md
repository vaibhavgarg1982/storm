STORM is a LLM system that writes Wikipedia-like articles from scratch based on Internet search.

While the system cannot produce publication-ready articles that often require a significant number of edits, experienced Wikipedia editors have found it helpful in their pre-writing stage.

**Try out our [live research preview](https://storm.genie.stanford.edu/) to see how STORM can help your knowledge exploration journey and please provide feedback to help us improve the system üôè!**



## How STORM works

STORM breaks down generating long articles with citations into two steps:
1. **Pre-writing stage**: The system conducts Internet-based research to collect references and generates an outline.
2. **Writing stage**: The system uses the outline and references to generate the full-length article with citations.

</p>

STORM identifies the core of automating the research process as automatically coming up with good questions to ask. Directly prompting the language model to ask questions does not work well. To improve the depth and breadth of the questions, STORM adopts two strategies:
1. **Perspective-Guided Question Asking**: Given the input topic, STORM discovers different perspectives by surveying existing articles from similar topics and uses them to control the question-asking process.
2. **Simulated Conversation**: STORM simulates a conversation between a Wikipedia writer and a topic expert grounded in Internet sources to enable the language model to update its understanding of the topic and ask follow-up questions.

Based on the separation of the two stages, STORM is implemented in a highly modular way using [dspy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy).



## Getting started

### 1. Setup

Below, we provide a quick start guide to run STORM locally.

1. Clone the git repository.
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/stanford-oval/storm.git
   cd storm
   ```
   
2. Install the required packages.
   ```shell
   conda create -n storm python=3.11
   conda activate storm
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up OpenAI API key (if you want to use OpenAI models to power STORM) and [You.com search API](https://api.you.com/) key. Create a file `secrets.toml` under the root directory and add the following content:
    ```shell
    # Set up OpenAI API key.
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
    # If you are using the API service provided by OpenAI, include the following line:
    OPENAI_API_TYPE="openai"
    # If you are using the API service provided by Microsoft Azure, include the following lines:
    OPENAI_API_TYPE="azure"
    AZURE_API_BASE="your_azure_api_base_url"
    AZURE_API_VERSION="your_azure_api_version"
    # Set up You.com search API key.
    YDC_API_KEY="your_youcom_api_key"
    ```


### 2. Running STORM-wiki locally

**To run STORM with `gpt` family models with default configurations**: Make sure you have set up the OpenAI API key and run the following command.

```shell
python examples/run_storm_wiki_gpt.py \
    --output-dir $OUTPUT_DIR \
    --retriever you \
    --do-research \
    --do-generate-outline \
    --do-generate-article \
    --do-polish-article
```
- `--do-research`: if True, simulate conversation to research the topic; otherwise, load the results.
- `--do-generate-outline`: If True, generate an outline for the topic; otherwise, load the results.
- `--do-generate-article`: If True, generate an article for the topic; otherwise, load the results.
- `--do-polish-article`:  If True, polish the article by adding a summarization section and (optionally) removing duplicate content.


We provide more example scripts under [`examples`](examples) to demonstrate how you can run STORM using your favorite language models or grounding on your own corpus.


## Customize STORM 

### Customization of the Pipeline

Besides running scripts in `examples`, you can customize STORM based on your own use case. STORM engine consists of 4 modules:

1. Knowledge Curation Module: Collects a broad coverage of information about the given topic.
2. Outline Generation Module: Organizes the collected information by generating a hierarchical outline for the curated knowledge.
3. Article Generation Module: Populates the generated outline with the collected information.
4. Article Polishing Module: Refines and enhances the written article for better presentation.

The interface for each module is defined in `src/interface.py`, while their implementations are instantiated in `src/storm_wiki/modules/*`. These modules can be customized according to your specific requirements (e.g., generating sections in bullet point format instead of full paragraphs).

:star2: **You can share your customization of `Engine` by making PRs to this repo!**

### Customization of Retriever Module

As a knowledge curation engine, STORM grabs information from the Retriever module. The Retriever modules are implemented in [`src/rm.py`](src/rm.py). Currently, STORM supports the following retrievers:

- `YouRM`: You.com search engine API
- `BingSearch`: Bing Search API
- `VectorRM`: a retrieval model that retrieves information from user provide corpus

:star2: **PRs for integrating more search engines/retrievers are highly appreciated!**

### Customization of Language Models

STORM provides the following language model implementations in [`src/lm.py`](src/lm.py):

- `OpenAIModel`
- `ClaudeModel`
- `VLLMClient`
- `TGIClient`
- `TogetherClient`

:star2: **PRs for integrating more language model clients are highly appreciated!**

:bulb: **For a good practice,** 

- choose a cheaper/faster model for `conv_simulator_lm` which is used to split queries, synthesize answers in the conversation.
- if you need to conduct the actual writing step, choose a more powerful model for `article_gen_lm`. Based on our experiments, weak models are bad at generating text with citations.
- for open models, adding one-shot example can help it better follow instructions.

Please refer to the scripts in the [`examples`](examples) directory for concrete guidance on customizing the language model used in the pipeline.

### Paper Experiments

The FreshWiki dataset used in our experiments can be found in [./FreshWiki](FreshWiki).
    
Run the following commands under [./src](src).

#### Pre-writing Stage
For batch experiment on FreshWiki dataset:
```shell
python -m scripts.run_prewriting --input-source file --input-path ../FreshWiki/topic_list.csv  --engine gpt-4 --do-research --max-conv-turn 5 --max-perspective 5
```
- `--engine` (choices=[`gpt-4`, `gpt-35-turbo`]): the LLM engine used for generating the outline
- `--do-research`: if True, simulate conversation to research the topic; otherwise, load the results.
- `--max-conv-turn`: the maximum number of questions for each information-seeking conversation
- `--max-perspective`: the maximum number of perspectives to be considered, each perspective corresponds to an information-seeking conversation. 
  - STORM also uses a general conversation to collect basic information about the topic. So, the maximum number of QA pairs is `max_turn * (max_perspective + 1)`. :bulb: Reducing `max_turn` or `max_perspective` can speed up the process and reduce the cost but may result in less comprehensive outline.
  - The parameter will not have any effect if `--disable-perspective` is set (the perspective-driven question asking is disabled).

To run the experiment on a single topic:
```shell
python -m scripts.run_prewriting --input-source console --engine gpt-4 --max-conv-turn 5 --max-perspective 5 --do-research
```
- The script will ask you to enter the `Topic` and the `Ground truth url` that will be excluded. If you do not have any url to exclude, leave that field empty.

The generated outline will be saved in `{output_dir}/{topic}/storm_gen_outline.txt` and the collected references will be saved in `{output_dir}/{topic}/raw_search_results.json`.


#### Writing Stage
For batch experiment on FreshWiki dataset:
```shell
python -m scripts.run_writing --input-source file --input-path ../FreshWiki/topic_list.csv --engine gpt-4 --do-polish-article --remove-duplicate
```
- `--do-polish-article`: if True, polish the article by adding a summarization section and removing duplicate content if `--remove-duplicate` is set True.

To run the experiment on a single topic:
```shell
python -m scripts.run_writing --input-source console --engine gpt-4 --do-polish-article --remove-duplicate
```
- The script will ask you to enter the `Topic`. Please enter the same topic as the one used in the pre-writing stage.

The generated article will be saved in `{output_dir}/{topic}/storm_gen_article.txt` and the references corresponding to citation index will be saved in `{output_dir}/{topic}/url_to_info.json`. If `--do-polish-article` is set, the polished article will be saved in `{output_dir}/{topic}/storm_gen_article_polished.txt`. 

### Customize the STORM Configurations
We set up the default LLM configuration in `LLMConfigs` in [src/modules/utils.py](src/modules/utils.py). You can use `set_conv_simulator_lm()`,`set_question_asker_lm()`, `set_outline_gen_lm()`, `set_article_gen_lm()`, `set_article_polish_lm()` to override the default configuration. These functions take in an instance from `dspy.dsp.LM` or `dspy.dsp.HFModel`.


### Automatic Evaluation

In our paper, we break down the evaluation into two parts: outline quality and full-length article quality.

#### Outline Quality
We introduce *heading soft recall* and *heading entity recall* to evaluate the outline quality. This makes it easier to prototype methods for pre-writing.

Run the following command under [./eval](eval) to compute the metrics on FreshWiki dataset:
```shell
python eval_outline_quality.py --input-path ../FreshWiki/topic_list.csv --gt-dir ../FreshWiki --pred-dir ../results --pred-file-name storm_gen_outline.txt --result-output-path ../results/storm_outline_quality.csv
```

#### Full-length Article Quality
[eval/eval_article_quality.py](eval/eval_article_quality.py) provides the entry point of evaluating full-length article quality using ROUGE, entity recall, and rubric grading. Run the following command under `eval` to compute the metrics:
```shell
python eval_article_quality.py --input-path ../FreshWiki/topic_list.csv --gt-dir ../FreshWiki --pred-dir ../results --gt-dir ../FreshWiki --output-dir ../results/storm_article_eval_results --pred-file-name storm_gen_article_polished.txt
```

#### Use the Metric Yourself
The similarity-based metrics (i.e., ROUGE, entity recall, and heading entity recall) are implemented in [eval/metrics.py](eval/metrics.py).

For rubric grading, we use the [prometheus-13b-v1.0](https://huggingface.co/prometheus-eval/prometheus-13b-v1.0) introduced in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08491). [eval/evaluation_prometheus.py](eval/evaluation_prometheus.py) provides the entry point of using the metric.
